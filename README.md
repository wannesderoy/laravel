laravel
=======

laravel test application.

It's a simple application. A user can create an account, verify his account via email, and he can edit his info.

There are features like remembering a user, personal user profile, account recovery, unique email verification code, etc...

Why
===

Just because I want to.
I wanted to learn the basics of Laravel, what it can do, and how I can do what I want to do.

In the process I also learned some new command line tool like Artisan, Composer. I also went deeper into git then I used to. And I plan to use SASS to give the whole thing a bit of style in the end
